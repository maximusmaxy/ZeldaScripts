# Zelda Scripts
These are the scripts I made in 2011/12 for the Project Zelda Engine. Also a random assortment of other scripts. I found these on an old computer and have had difficulty finding them anywhere else on the internet so i'm putting them in a git for safe keeping. If you want to contact me about anything related to the project throw me an email at maxwelllittlejohn@gmail.com.

Special thanks to SilentResident, Night_Runner, Baffou and Chakanevil for putting up with me while i was on the team.
